Basic Increment operator is <<++>> and increments some value by "1" one unit

Info From FCC:
<<
i++;

is the equivalent of

i = i + 1;

Note
The entire line becomes i++;, eliminating the need for the equal sign.>>

So essentially a shorter expression:  10 chars (incl spaces) versus 4 chars (no spaces necc).
