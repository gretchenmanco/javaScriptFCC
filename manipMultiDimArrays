*  Example of accessing multidimensional arrays from FCC:

When you use brackets to access your array, the first set of brackets refers to the entries in the outer-most (the first level) array,
and each additional pair of brackets refers to the next level of entries inside.

Example

    var arr = [
        [1,2,3],
        [4,5,6],
        [7,8,9],
        [[10,11,12], 13, 14]
    ];
    arr[3]; // equals [[10,11,12], 13, 14]
    arr[3][0]; // equals [10,11,12]
    arr[3][0][1]; // equals 11

END of quote from FCC *

*  .PUSH() function:  append END item ONLY to Array *
The .push() function is a method of appending data to an end of an array.  .push() takes parameters and places "pushes" them onto the 
end of the array.

Example: 

var myArrPushEx = [1,5,9,100000];
myArrPushEx.push(7); // myArrPushEx becomes [1,5,9,100000,7]



* .POP() function:  remove END item ONLY from Array *

The .pop() function is used to remove some value from the END of an array.  
Notably, 
1:  the "popped" (removed) value can be stored in a variable for future use.  
2:  Any type of value inside an array can be "popped" (removed)--including entire nested arrays!!  IMPORTANT!!!!


* .UNSHIFT function:  ADDS item ONLY to BEGINNING of Array *

The .unshift() function is like the PUSH function EXCEPT that is for the BEGINNING of the Array


















* .SHIFT function:  remove FIRST item ONLY from Array *

The .shift() function removes only the FIRST value from an array.
