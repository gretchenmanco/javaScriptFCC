Info re: remainders in JS

The Remainder operator is the <<%>> per-cent symbol.

The Remainder operator gives the remainder of the division of two actual numbers.  EX:  5 % 2 = 1 because "4" is obtained as a whole quotient
but there yet remains a "1" after subtracting the four from the five.  THIS IS LIKE the MATH USED in obtaining a BINARY number (during
conversion from decimal to binary).

From FCC:
<< 
Usage
In mathematics, a number can be checked [as being] even or odd by checking the remainder of the division of the [said] number by 2.
>>

IMPORTANT!!  "remainder" operator is NOT THE SAME as the "modulus" operator!!!
